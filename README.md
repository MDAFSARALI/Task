# About the task

**The task is to build a basic e-commerce product listing page using React, designed to display products with essential information, including images, names, prices, and optional ratings. The page should allow users to sort products by price (low to high or high to low). Users can also filter products by category and price range and search by product name. The layout must be responsive, with an optional feature to view detailed product information in a modal.**
